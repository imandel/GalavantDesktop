# Debugs by Chenran
**Chenran Ning**
I will updates the bugs I encounter in the process.

## 1. Running

- Running issues with `npm` `localhost:5000`: It won't render when I used `5000`. I used `http://127.0.0.1:5000` instead and it will solve the problem. It seems there are some bugs inside node.js dependencies and vscode. Also with some bugs along with the OS.
